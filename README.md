* The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the Gapminder dataset from a
URL. It then fits two linear regression models: a simple model with only year as a predictor,
and a more complex model that includes year, continent, and their interaction.
* Using these models, the code performs an F-test to compare their fit, calculating the improvement
in R-squared. This helps determine if the more complex model significantly improves
upon the simpler one.
* Next, the code calculates residuals and fitted values for the interaction model. It uses these
to create two violin plots: one showing residuals versus year, and another showing residuals
versus fitted values. These plots are generated using Seaborn’s violinplot function, with the
data grouped by year or binned fitted values, respectively.
* The resulting plots visually represent the distribution of residuals across different years and
ranges of fitted values. This allows for a graphical assessment of key linear regression assumptions:
linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals.
* By examining these plots, we can evaluate how well the interaction model satisfies these
assumptions and identify any potential issues or patterns in the residuals. This visual analysis
complements the earlier statistical tests, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model’s
performance and validity.
